\title{Resample for bootstrap variance continuous Y}
\usage{
Resample.gamma.continuousY(data, indices)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{synthetic data}

\item{indices}{row indices to replicate}
}
\value{
numeric vector of regression coefficients

\description{
Resampling function to get bootstrap variance for continuous Y. Note that
readers need to modify the existing function Resample.gamma.continuousY() to
match their own Steps 1-5. It was only included in the package for the
purpose of providing an example.
